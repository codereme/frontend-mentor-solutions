## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**Semantic HTML**

- Used an `<article>` as our main card component

**Styling and Layout Approach**

- Implemented a design system based on the `Figma design` and style guide, using `CSS custom properties` for colors, font styles and elements spacing
- Wrapped everything in a `.container` div to center the component with `Flexbox`
- `Mobile-first` workflow

**Accessibility and SEO fundamentals**

- ARIA label for enhanced context
- Seo-friendly meta tags and descriptions
